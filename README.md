# Installing

```sh
npm i discord-user-bots
```

# What is this library?

### Discord-User-Bots is a library that allows for complete access & control over user accounts

This library supports account features that are exclusive to user accounts or hidden by the Discord documentation. Data-mining Discord was used to find the vulnerabilities and hidden endpoints that allow this library to function.

# What can this do?

### Some use-cases for this library are:

-   Creating accounts (EXPERIMENTAL)
-   Sending unrestricted friend requests to other users
-   Joining guilds without triggering Discord's trust system
-   Email and phone verifying accounts
-   Accessing user notes, friend counts, interacting with the default Discord tutorial, and every other property associated with a Discord account
-   Remotely controlling accounts without authenticating with Discord for distributed account control
-   Common functions real accounts use
-   And many more...

# Getting started

## Controlling an account

> For comments: **https://github.com/Sopur/Discord-user-bots/blob/main/examples/basic.js**

```js
// For comments and more detail: https://github.com/Sopur/Discord-user-bots/blob/main/examples/basic.js
const Discord = require("discord-user-bots");
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.on("ready", () => {
    console.log("Client online!");
});
client.on("message", (message) => {
    console.log(message);
});

client.login("token goes here.");
```

## Controlling an account without logging in

> For comments: **https://github.com/Sopur/Discord-user-bots/blob/main/examples/basic-headless.js** > _WARNING: if there isn't another live instance of the account running while you make a request with a headless client, the account will be disabled and flagged._

```js
// For comments and more detail: https://github.com/Sopur/Discord-user-bots/blob/main/examples/basic-headless.js
const Discord = require("discord-user-bots");
const client = new Discord.Client({
    headless: true,
    proxy: "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxx",
});
client.login("Token goes here."); // ONLY sets the token (doesn't follow the full login process)

client.send("1234567890", {
    content: "This message was sent without logging in",
});
```
